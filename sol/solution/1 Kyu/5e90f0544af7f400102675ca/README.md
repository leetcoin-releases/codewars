## **Description:**
Given the lists with suppliers' production, consumers' demand, and the matrix of supplier-to-consumer transportation costs, calculate the minimum cost of the products transportation which satisfied all the demand.

## **Notes**
- Costs-matrix legend: `costs[i][j]` is the cost of transporting 1 unit of produce from `suppliers[i]` to `consumers[j]`
- The produce is identical - multiple suppliers can be the source for one consumer, and multiple consumers can be the target of one supplier
- The produce is not important - it can be anything and have any price, we're only interested in transporting it efficiently
- Total supply will always equal total demand
- Your solution should pass `12` cases with matrices of size `150x150` as a performance test (the reference solution itself takes `~8500 ms` to do so)
- For all tests, `0 <= costs[i][j] <= 100`
- In performance tests, `1 <= suppliers[i], consumers[j] <= 10000`
- Disabled modules are `scipy` and `sklearn`
- Disabled built-in functions are `open`, `exec`, `eval`, `globals`, `locals` and `exit`

## **Example**
Given these inputs:
```md
suppliers = [10, 20, 20]

consumers = [5, 25, 10, 10]

costs = 
    [2  5  3  0]
    [3  4  1  4]
    [2  6  5  2]
```

The shipments can be arranged the following way:
```md
[            10]  | 10
[    10  10    ]  | 20
[ 5  15        ]  | 20
------------------+---
  5  25  10  10   |
```

By multiplying each element of this matrix by the corresponding element of the costs matrix, we get the result:
```md
[             0]
[    40  10    ]  =>  0 + 40 + 10 + 10 + 90 = 150
[10  90        ]
```
